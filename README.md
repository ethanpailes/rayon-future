# rayon future

Just a little hold-over hack until https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/pull/679 gets merged.

I mostly threw this together out of a reluctance to directly depend on a development branch.
This only depends on stable public interfaces of stable published crates. I'll keep the
interface of this stable unless someone points out a major bug.
